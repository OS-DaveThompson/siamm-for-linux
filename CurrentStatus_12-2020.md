This project has been put on hold. (Dec 15, 2020)

The main problem I ran into was the capitalization-aware nature of the Linux filesystem
vs the complete disregard of capitalization under Windows.  Not an unsolvable problem, and
as I came to understand would not have proven to be a penalty in performance or convenience.
But it meant too much additional load for me to get up to speed and would have taken away
too much from my effort to finish my B.S.

I expect to get this back up and running sometime mid-2121.  While new games are hitting
the scene all the time, I think the fallout4 mod community and more widely the Linux gamers
who would like to have a more native experience playing their games with mods on Linux.

Peace, stay safe.
